## Hi there 👋

Hi, I'm Hanze Liang. I'm currently pursuing a dual bachelor's degree in Management and Science at Shenzhen University, which I completed in three years. I plan to join MBZUAI this year to pursue a PhD in Computational Biology. I have also spent time training and studying at several tech organizations and research institutes.
